        "*Authors: Leo Klarner, Jin Xu*\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is one of the most popular programming languages in current use. If you have ever taken a machine learning course or participated in a data science hackathon, chances are you have already written some Python code. Reasons that Python is so popular include that it:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   is freely available and installable on virtually any system\n",
        "*   has an intuitive syntax that emphasises simplicity and readability \n",
        "*   has a large user base with many high-quality open-source libraries\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "By [design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python), Python tries to encourage code that is as clear and understandable as possible.\n",
        "As an example, have a look at the following C++/Python code snippets that count from 0 to 2, multiply each number by 10, and print the results:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "// C++ script that iterates through the numbers 0, 1 and 2,\n",
        "// multiplies each of them by 10 and prints the results\n",
        "#include <iostream>\n",
        "using namespace std;\n",
        "int main() {\n",
        "        int j = 10;\n",
        "        for (int i = 0; i <= 2; i++) {\n",
        "          cout << i * j << endl;\n",
        "        }\n",
        "    return 0;\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "# the equivalent script in Python\n",
        "j = 10\n",
        "for i in range(3):\n",
        "  print(i * j)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "You can already see a couple of the design decisions that make writing and reading Python code much easier than in other languages. One of them is that code segments are simply denoted by indenting lines by multiples of 2 or 4 spaces, in contrast to relying on encapsulating statements such as braces. \n",
        "Additionally, variables in Python are dynamically typed, meaning that their data type (e.g. integer, floating point, ...) is determined at run time and we don't have to worry as much about type compatibilities when writing the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "More abstractly, Python is also very flexible in supporting a range of different programming paradigms (such as procedural, object-oriented and functional programming) that we will have a closer look at later on, making it a versatile general-purpose language.\n",
        "\n",
        "The cost of this easier and more straight-forward way of coding is that programmes written in Python are usually much slower than their equivalents in more restrictive languages such as C/C++. However, many of the open-source libraries mentioned above allow us to outsource some of the computationally expensive parts of our programme to faster languages, while still being able to write most of our code in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",

        "## Objective of this course\n",
        "\n",
        "This course will teach you the basic programming skills that are required for a successful research project in the areas of machine learning and data science. It is split into the following three modules:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   We will start with an introduction to fundamental concepts of programming in Python, covering the basic syntax required to write working code. \n",
        "2.   We will then look at a range of widely-used libraries that underpin most scientific computing research in Python.\n",
        "3.   Lastly, we will focus on software engineering best practices that will allow you to produce maintainable and reproducible code that can be used and extended by yourself and others.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "As many of you will come into this course with different levels of programming/Python experience, we encourage you to work through it at your own speed. The solutions to all excercises can be found at the bottom of the notebook. Taking the time to understand an exercise and solving it without looking at the solution will be a much more productive and rewarding way to learn that will save you time in the long run."
